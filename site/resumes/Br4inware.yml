    summary: |
      My eagerness to learn is one of my most prominent characteristics.
      When something catches my attention, I can increase my focus by 200%.
      That's how I learned the vast majority of what I know today,
      from repairing electronic devices to learning to play various
      instruments like the guitar, piano, ukulele, and bass, as well as 
      exploring different musical genres to learn new techniques.
      All of this was self-taught.

       I completed a vocational training program at the intermediate level,
       where I learned network operating systems, computer assembly and maintenance,
       office applications, single-user operating systems, and the creation and administration
       of Windows and Ubuntu servers. I also learned to use the CMD and Bash command-line
       interfaces and created scripts in text files modified from the terminal.

       Also, during my mandatory unpaid internship, I overhauled the entire printing system
       for the public network of the Sagunto City Council, the town where I live, as well as
       configuring new computer equipment for new departments. Finally, we conducted research
       on the deep web.
